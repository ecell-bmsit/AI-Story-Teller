In those ancient times, stories weren't just tales; they were the heartbeat of our shared humanity. Passed through whispers and etched on cave walls, storytelling was the lifeline of wisdom, carrying the soulful narratives of our ancestors. It was more than mere words; creating a timeless bond betweenÂ individuals.</p>
